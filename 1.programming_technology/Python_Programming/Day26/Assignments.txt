Use Lambda functions
num="5,2,3,9,5,6,11,8,9"
lst = num.split(",")
sum=0
add=lambda x : int(x) + sum
for i in lst:
	sum=add(i)
print(sum)

string = "A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of
 arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform

 to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a complete computer
 that includes the hardware operating system main software  and peripheral
 equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer 
to a group of computers that are linked and function together"
