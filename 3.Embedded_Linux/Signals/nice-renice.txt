Nice value is a user-space and priority PR is the process's actual priority that use by Linux kernel.

In linux system priorities are 0 to 139 in which 0 to 99 for real time and 100 to 139 for users. 

nice value range is -20 to +19 where -20 is highest, 0 default and +19 is lowest. relation between nice value and priority is :

PR = 20 + NI

so , the value of PR = 20 + (-20 to +19) is 0 to 39 that maps 100 to 139.

According to top manual:

PR -- Priority The scheduling priority of the task. If you see 'rt' in this field, it means the task is running under 'real time' scheduling priority.

NI is nice value of task.

NI -- Nice Value The nice value of the task. A negative nice value means higher priority, 

whereas a positive nice value means lower priority.Zero in this field simply means 

priority will not be adjusted in determining a task's dispatch-ability

By default when a program is launched in Linux, 

it gets launched with the priority of '0'. 

However you can change the priority of your programs by either of the following methods.

You can launch a program with your required priority using

nice -n nice_value program_name

you can also change the priority of an already running process using

renice -n nice_value -p process_id
