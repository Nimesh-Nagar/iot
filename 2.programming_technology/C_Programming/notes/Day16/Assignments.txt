Q1. WAP to Convert from one type of pointer/address to other using void*

Q2. WAP to Test arithmetic operation on void pointers

Q3. Try some nested calls sqrt(pow(2,abs(x))), putchar(toupper(ch)) etc

Q4. Write a function to swap two variables Pass by reference (Allocate memory on heap)

Q5. Study about various functions which can convert from string to
different types
atoi, atol, atoll, atof
strtoimax, strtol, strtoul, strtof, strtod etc
man -k strto – for more listing

Q6. WAP to Addition of two arrays(Allocate on heap)

Q7.Create a IOT Home device Management:(Use Dynamic memory allocation)
1.Add new Home
2.Display Home
3.Search Home by HomOwner
4.Change device name
5.Search Device by DeviceName
Home Data members : homeId,HomeOwner,Address,Device[2] 
Device Data members: deviceId, DeviceName,DeviceType(Sensors/Actuators),voltage



Observe the below questions:
Q1. Try the following code
union A
{
int x;
int y;
char ch;
};
union A a1;
a1.x=0x10;
a1.y=0x1121; print a1.x, a1.ch
Calculate size of union , offset of each member

Q2. Analyse the following code
union A
{
int x;
float y;
double z;
int arr[2];
}a1;
a1.y=6.25f;
printf(“x=%x\n”,a1.x);
a1.z=0.15625;;
printf(“%x%x\n”,a1.arr[1],a1.arr[0]);

Q3. Whats wrong in the following code, suggest a fix for this.
struct A
{
int x;
char *str; // (or) char str[20];
};
struct A a1 = { 101, “abc” } , a2;
a1.x=10;
a1.str=”hello”; //works?
scanf(“%d%s”,&a1.x,a1.str); //works?
a2 = a1; //shallow copy or deep copy?
What if str is declared as an array instead of pointer, i.e. charstr[20]
