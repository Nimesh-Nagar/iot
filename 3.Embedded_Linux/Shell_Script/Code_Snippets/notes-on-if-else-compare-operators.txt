write a shell script to take three input from user:
1. studentname must be string
2. branchname must be string
3. age must be number
4. salary must be number
if student and branch name matches display you are part of this
organization else you are not allowed to enter.
if salary and age matches then you are no more student but employee
else:
you are still student work hard to become employee.

Comparison operators:
--> string1 = string2 and string1 == string2.
--> The equality operator returns true if the operands are equal.
= operator should be used with test command
== operator should be used with test condiiton [[]] for pattern matching.

Example:
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter first string : " str1
read -p "enter second string : " str2
if [ $str1 = $str2 ]; then
    echo "Strings are equal"
else
    echo "Strings are not equal"
fi
#Recommended for pattern matching but not mandetory.
if [[ $str1 == "Hi" ]]; then
    echo "Strings are equal"
else
    echo "Strings are not equal"
fi

Point to note:
1. [ string1 = string2] returns true if both matches
2. [[ string1 == string2 ]] returns true if both matches
inequality operators:
> -greater than
< -less than
-z if string length is zero
-n if tsring length is non zero

Compare numbers in shell Script:
-------------------------------------
num1 -eq num2                  check if 1st  number is equal to 2nd number
num1 -ge num2                  checks if 1st  number  is greater than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -gt num2                  checks if 1st  number is greater than 2nd number
num1 -le num2                   checks if 1st number is less than or equal to 2nd number
num1 -lt num2                   checks if 1st  number  is less than 2nd number
num1 -ne num2                  checks if 1st  number  is not equal to 2nd number
